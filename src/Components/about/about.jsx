          We bring you Zenith&apos;23, the 8th edition of our college sports
          extravaganza with the conviction to go beyond Zenith&apos;22. The
          Ignited spirits shall be unleashed and we shall "DEVOUR THE VICTORY".
          Last year we hosted this event in the heated month of April. Best
          student athletes from across the state will converge to perspire and
          showcase their talents with competing for the title of being the best.
          With a wide variety of sports to choose from, basketball, football,
          volleyball, kabaddi etc, there is something for everyone to enjoy.
          From the thrill of the basketball court to the intensity of the track
          and field, this is a competition you won&apos;t want to miss. Join us
          as we come together to celebrate the passion, dedication, and hard
          work of these exceptional young athletes.
